# esp-sdk-ivory

This is a project for using the ESP SDK (for ESP8266) on Haskell via
[Ivory](http://ivorylang.org/).  It is specifically for the non-OS SDK
(that is, not involving the RTOS).  *(TODO: Should that be Espressif
SDK, not ESP SDK?)*

See *ESP8266 Non-OS SDK API Guide* at
<https://espressif.com/en/support/download/documents> for a reference
on the API that this is wrapping.
